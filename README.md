# 2D-spinning-disc-FEM

The program calculates displacement, stresses and strains for a 2D spinning disc (neglible thickness).
Axisymmetric_disc_FEM.m is the main matlab file.

The program finds the solution by using Finite Element Method with 2 - node elements. The integration 
is done using numerical integration (Gaussian quadrature).
